The University of Dayton Arena is the venue for the annual
WGI&nbsp;Percussion&nbsp;Championships.

To make this video, I converted a 3D model from the SketchUp Warehouse to a
Collada&nbsp;.dae&nbsp;file.

Then, I manipulated the zoom and rotation in Apple's Quartz Composer
visual&nbsp;programming&nbsp;environment.
