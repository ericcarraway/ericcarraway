    Front-end engineer.&nbsp; Contractor at Rackspace.&nbsp; Band&nbsp;nerd.
</p>
Hi, I'm Eric.&nbsp; I'm carving a niche as a musician, educator, and software developer in
<span>San Antonio,&nbsp;Texas</span>.

I currently work as a front-end developer for <span>TEKsystems</span> in a full-time contract position at
<span>Rackspace Hosting</span>.&nbsp; In my free time, I enjoy working on various music software passion projects.

Prior to becoming a software developer,
I was a high school band director from 2005-2014.&nbsp; I hold a Master of Music degree from
the <span>University of Texas at Austin</span> and a Music Education degree from
<span>Kent&nbsp;State University</span>&nbsp;(Ohio).

When I'm not writing code, I enjoy spending time with my beautiful wife Katie.
