Hi, I'm Eric.&nbsp; I'm carving a niche as a musician, educator, and software developer in
San Antonio,&nbsp;Texas.

I currently work as a front-end developer for TEKsystems in a full-time contract role at
Rackspace Hosting.&nbsp; In my free time, I enjoy working on various music software passion-projects.

Prior to becoming a full-time software developer,
I was a high school band director from 2005-2014.&nbsp; I hold a Master of Music degree from
the University of Texas at Austin and a Music Education degree from
Kent&nbsp;State University&nbsp;(Ohio).

When I'm not writing code, I enjoy spending time with my beautiful wife Katie.
