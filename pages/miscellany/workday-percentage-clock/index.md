<h1 class="page-title">Workday Percentage&nbsp;Clock</h1>
One of the most difficult tasks in software engineering is the estimation of time.
To increase my productivity and time-management skills, I created this
alternative clock face.

I was intrigued by the idea of a percentage-based approach to the perception of time.
Instead of dividing an 8 AM - 5 PM workday into hours, I divided it into ten chunks -
each representing 10 percent of the workday.
