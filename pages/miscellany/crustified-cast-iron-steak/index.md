# Crustified Cast&nbsp;Iron&nbsp;Steak

_Forget the grill - prepare the perfect steak by searing it on a cast iron skillet
and baking it in an&nbsp;oven_

## Directions:
* Use a dry rub for maximum&nbsp;crustification
  * _Substitution:_ cracked pepper and sea salt (or kosher&nbsp;salt)
* Bring the meat closer to room temperature by resting the steaks for 30-60 minutes on the&nbsp;counter
* Oil your cast iron skillet
  * Use a high smoke point oil
  * Safflower oil is great for any high smoke point&nbsp;cooking
  * **DO NOT USE OLIVE OIL**
* Heat the cast iron skillet
  * Set the stovetop to nearly the hottest setting
  * This will take 5-10 minutes depending on how quickly your stovetop&nbsp;heats
  * The pan may smoke - turn on a fan, open a window, and don't be startled by your smoke&nbsp;alarm
* Sear the steak for two minutes on each side
* Place the skillet in the oven with the broiler on high
  * Approximately 4-5 minutes for medium-rare (less for smaller or leaner&nbsp;steaks)
  * Approximately 5-6 minutes for medium
* Remove the pan from the oven
* Place the steak on a cutting board or plate
  * _Optional:_ Cover loosely with aluminum foil or a dish&nbsp;towel
  * Let it rest for 5-10 minutes without cutting into&nbsp;it
