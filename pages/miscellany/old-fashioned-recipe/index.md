### Saving Keystrokes
We have a principle in software development called **DRY**.&nbsp;
The aim of
[_Don't Repeat Yourself_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
is to reduce the repetition of information and manual&nbsp;tasks.

### What?
My friend JY shared his old fashioned cocktail recipe with me at a dinner party last year.&nbsp;
Since then, numerous friends have requested&nbsp;it.
