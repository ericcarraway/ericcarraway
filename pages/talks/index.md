Join us as Eric Carraway shares his experience as a recent graduate of Coder Camps, a Houston-based .NET bootcamp that teaches people with minimal programming experience the skills needed to fill roles as junior developers in as little as 9-weeks.  Eric is one of many fresh developers entering our career field through the relatively new pathway that is coding bootcamps.  Eric will talk about the curriculum and rigor of the .NET instructional program, as well as personal insights on transitioning from a career as a high school band director to a career as a developer.
