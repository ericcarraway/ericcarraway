# CodingBat Problems in JavaScript

<a href="http://codingbat.com/">CodingBat</a>
is an excellent resource for practicing method code;
it played a significant role in my growth as a developer. &nbsp;Its author,
<a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/nick/">Nick Parlante</a>, offers simple
algorithm challenges in an environment that provides immediate feedback with unit-tests.

Solving each of these puzzles in 5 to 20 line functions brings the same joys and benefits that
practicing scales does for me as a musician.

CodingBat features problems in Java and Python. &nbsp;I'm working towards solving the problems with
JavaScript.&nbsp;
<a href="https://github.com/ericcarraway/codingbat-js/">The in-progress project is on GitHub</a>.

## Sample Problem
> _We want to make a package of **goal** kilos of chocolate. &nbsp;We have small bars (1 kilo each)
> and big bars (5 kilos each). &nbsp;Return the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use
> big bars before small bars.&nbsp; Return -1 if it can't be done._

## Setup
The `codingbat-js` repo can be <a href="https://github.com/ericcarraway/codingbat-js/">
downloaded as a Zip file (or forked) on GitHub.</a>

A text editor and web browser are all that are required to work through these problems.&nbsp;
I feel that a simple browser-based <a href="https://qunitjs.com/">QUnit</a> setup offers a lower
barrier to entry than other unit testing frameworks that require familiarity with the command line.

## Future Plans
Ideally, a user would be able to go to a website and complete challenges in a purely browser-based
environment. &nbsp;A few options exist for building a client-side JavaScript sandbox.&nbsp;
A simpler solution, however, is to use a service like JSFiddle, CodePen, or Plunker.

Here's the `makeChocolate` puzzle on Plunker:

for this project.
