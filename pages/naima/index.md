# Naima for Front Ensemble
_Naima_ is a technical étude for front&nbsp;ensemble designed to focus on the double&nbsp;vertical
stroke (block&nbsp;chords).&nbsp;
It is based on a John&nbsp;Coltrane ballad from the 1959 album _Giant&nbsp;Steps_.&nbsp;
I arranged this for the **Glassmen Front&nbsp;Ensemble** in 2011.

### Visualizing Chord Shapes
I created this visualization for my students to aide in their learning of the vibraphone part.&nbsp;
The vibe part is somewhat challenging to memorize because it employs rootless voicings.&nbsp;
An understanding of chord-melody jazz guitar will help.

### A Chord-Melody Approach, à la Jazz Guitar
In arranging _Naima_, I placed certain rules and limitations on myself.&nbsp;
These rules and limitations were inspired by the chord-melody style of jazz
guitar&nbsp;playing.&nbsp;
Keep the following in mind when learning:

**Guideline #1:** &nbsp;
The melody note is always on top and the chords are voiced _downwards_.&nbsp;
If you're used to learning chords by building up from the lowest note, stop and learn the
melody first.

**Guideline #2:** &nbsp;
Use the resonance and openness of a fifth to reinforce the melody.&nbsp;
The first note under the melody (mallet #3) will almost always be a fifth below and will almost always be
on the same manual of the keyboard - either both are white notes or both are black notes.

**Guideline #3:** &nbsp;
In choosing notes for mallets #1 and #2, favor guide tones (thirds and sevenths) if these pitches
haven't been covered by mallets #3 and #4.
