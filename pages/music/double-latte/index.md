## Double Latte for Front Ensemble
_Double Latte_ is a technical Ã©tude for front ensemble. &nbsp;
I designed it to develop two&nbsp;techniques:

* **Marimbas**: &nbsp;double lateral strokes
* **Vibes**: &nbsp;melodic lines in octaves

I wrote this for the **Glassmen Front&nbsp;Ensemble** in 2008, then added the melody for the
**Churchill High&nbsp;School Front&nbsp;Ensemble** in 2015.

### Meter
Each four-bar phrase is comprised of three bars of 5/8 followed by a bar of 3/4. &nbsp;
You can find this time signature pattern in the verse sections of Dave Matthews Band's&nbsp;

&nbsp;on the 2002 album _Busted&nbsp;Stuff_.

### Harmony
Key centers move in [chromatic mediant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_mediant)
fashion. &nbsp;We ascend through the Dorian/minor keys of
A, C#, E, and G &nbsp;-&nbsp; then descend through G#, E, C#, and A. &nbsp;

Marimbas play double lateral sticking patterns over sus4&nbsp;chords. &nbsp;Hands remain in fourths,
and turns are never required. &nbsp;
This provides an optimal level of comfort so that the performer's focus can remain on technique.

### Melody
While the marimbas exercise the double lateral stroke, vibraphones focus on a skill more idiomatic
to their role in the ensemble: &nbsp;melodic playing in octaves.

The melody is inspired by the jazz standard&nbsp;

&nbsp;-&nbsp; composed around 1972 by pianist Steve&nbsp;Kuhn.
